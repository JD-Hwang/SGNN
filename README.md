# Scanner-Generalization Neural Networks (*SGNN*)
* This is the codes for training *SGNN* implemented Python3 with PyTorch framework. It is inspired by domain-adaptation [1] with combining weight sparsity control [2] for DNN.
* Task of the SGNN is to predict individual's General psychopathology factor (*p*-factor) based on vectorized Resting-state Functional connectivity (RSFC) inputs.
